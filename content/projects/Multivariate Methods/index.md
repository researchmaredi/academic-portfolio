This collection features assignments and projects completed during my honours Multivariate Methods module. It focuses on uncovering latent structures in high-dimensional datasets using dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Implement dimensionality reduction to simplify complex datasets (PCA)
- Model relationships between distinct sets of variables (Canonical Correlation Analysis)
- Uncover latent psychological constructs using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
- Perform and validate clustering algorithms (Hierarchical & K-Means)

## Tools & Technologies
- R Language
- Tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2)
- FactoMineR / factoextra
- Psych Package
- CCA & Cluster Packages

## Key Outcomes
- Visualized high-dimensional data using Biplots and Scree plots
- Determined optimal factor extraction using Parallel Analysis
- Interpreted complex variable relationships through Varimax and Oblimin rotations
- Identified robust data segments using Dendrograms and K-Means profiling
