This collection features assignments and projects completed during my honours Bayesian Modelling module. It demonstrates statistical inference using both custom R implementations and the Stan probabilistic programming language.

## Objectives
- Derive analytical posteriors and implement basic MCMC (Gibbs/Metropolis) in R
- Utilize Stan for high-performance Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling
- Conduct model comparison and hypothesis testing

## Tools & Technologies
- R Language
- Stan (via rstan)
- R Markdown
- CODA / BayesPlot
- LaTeX

## Key Outcomes
- Efficient sampling of complex posteriors using NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler)
- Rigorous convergence diagnostics (Trace plots, R-hat, ESS)
- Hierarchical modeling and uncertainty quantification
